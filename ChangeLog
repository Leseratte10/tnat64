        * Fix malloc return code checking error

        * Autotools modernisation
          - Fix autoheader issue (crashed, did not generate config.h.in).
          - Create Makefile.am, use automake, rm manually-created Makefile.in.
          - Put m4 cache in m4/, make stub file there to preserve directory.
          - Generate tnat64 / tnat64.8 from tnat64.in / tnat64.8.in, thereby
            allowing them to be specialized to current configuration.
          - Delete files which can be generated by autoreconf --install
        * Update INSTALL instructions
